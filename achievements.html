				<p> This was my first ever presentation to be honest and we (myself and my teammate <b>MANISH</b>) gave our best.The topic we presented was "Math in Astronomy".	
			   		Since this was our first presentation, we didn't actually know the rules or any such things. Gladly we knew not to decorate the slides and kept it professional. Loved that feeling when they announced the winners and our team was in that list! Not to mention, this trophy is priceless for me as it is also my first big achievement.</p>

				<p>Few months after my first presentation, i went on to attend some workshops and other contests. So this time, again made a hasty decision the day before the registration got over, we (Myself and my teammate <b>ASHIK</b>) booked our spot. It was not until the previous day we completed our slides, also prepared only during the travel time. Good thing Ashik had a long way to travel(40km). We messed up then and there but managed to deliver the content within the time alloted. We met some really amazing people as rivals.</p>

				<p>Before my paper presentations, i went on to some workshops to explore new things and add a neural bridge. This was a particularly memorable workshop as i went to this workshop with my school friends (Got a chance after a long time). But that's not the only reason though.
				Truth be told, this workshop did not turn as good as i expected it to be. But i consider this as a kickstart to my Machine learning career.</p>

				<p> Huge numbers turned out for this workshop. Paid plently, learnt nothing. It was this workshop that taught me not to get fooled by fancy names and advertisements. Literally nothing was taught on this topic. But thanks to this incident i aquired the ability to classify what workshops to attend and what not.</p>

				<p> And then came this amazing workshop! I'm really thankful for both the organizers and the instructors. These kind of workshops do justice to the definition of a workshop. Yes, we learnt many things with Hands-on training, and many more. One of the best workshops ever!</p>

				<p> Hands down, the best workshop ever. This 7-day program is one of the productive workshops in the quarantine period. Learnt to build a working AI Chatbot from Scratch! The instructor did a very good job in taking the sessions more interactive and taught things i thought that never existed. Was worth every penny.</p>

If there is one thing that i don't mind doing anytime, it is learning Japanese language. A great stress buster and a really good way to make my day productive. </span>

					<p>This project was started with a team of 4 members. In this pic, we were demonstrating the idea of Wireless charging invloved in electric vehicles, their merits and demerits. After passing round 1, we were asked to explain. But unfortunately we couldn't get past round 2... Failing in this project was a huge blow to me and my team because we thought we did good but it turned out we didn't.

					<p>This project involved a lot of team effort and was time consuming. This was regarding how to use image processing to detect sign boards, signals, objects, lane and many such things. This project became a turning point in my life. I was awstruck by knowing what machines could do once they learn. It tooks weeks of writing code and building a bot that used raspberry pi for processing the images. Went on to Saihackfest finals but unfortunately failed to get selected for SIH finals.</p>
